# Installation

- Go to .config/brew dir and run brew bundle install

- Run the `install.sh` script that should install everything that's needed.

### Sketchy bar
#### After the `install.sh` script run the following commands to set the right fonts:
```
curl -L https://github.com/kvndrsslr/sketchybar-app-font/releases/download/latest/sketchybar-app-font.ttf -o $HOME/Library/Fonts/sketchybar-app-font.ttf
```
